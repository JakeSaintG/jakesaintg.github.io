                        <p><strong> Hi! I’m Jake St. Germain and I am a software developer! After 5 years of being a Pediatric ICU Nurse, I
                            decided to pursue the long term passion of mine and switch to tech. I have always had a love for it and have shown an aptitude for
                            learning quickly in the tech area. My time in the ICU has helped me to remain calm, cool, and collected under pressure. </strong></p>
                        <p><strong> Random tidbits! Like the headline says, I am a cat enthusiast and have three of the fluffy nerds. I have built computers 
                            for myself and a few of my friends, and love spending time on my 
                            <a href="https://onewheel.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OneWheel!</a> I also like to spend my free time 
                            playing video games and finding solutions to problems with side coding projects. </strong></p>

                        <p><strong> Starting with college, I attended the University of Louisville where I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Nursing. My
                            overall GPA was a 3.7/4.0 and I found myself on the Dean’s List for 3 Semesters and as a Dean’s Scholar for 2 Semesters. This was all
                            while having two jobs for most of those semesters! While being a nurse I strove for additional training in Pediatric Advanced Life Support
                            (PALS) as well as in PRISMA (Continuous Dialysis). Now time for coding! I started my dev career with Code Louisville through their frontend, JavaScript, 
                            and C# courses. This also gave me access to Team Treehouse where I continued to soak in as much development knowledge as I could.</strong></p>

                        <p><strong> My first and foremost goal is to gain more experience in development. This certainly is a profession that requires one to
                            be a life-long learner. Whether it is at a giant tech company or a little start-up, I strive the be the best dev that I can be.
                            My hope is to make software that helps people live better lives. I also hope to utilize my experience in nursing</strong></p>

                    <h2 class="head">Experience</h2>
                    <p><strong> I worked pretty hard in college. In addition to a pretty difficult curriculum, I rotated through various positions within 
                        the Student Housing department at UofL. I was a Resident Assistant for four years, worked a desk/security job for a year, worked 
                        low-level maintenance/IT for a year, and then coordinated maintenance in two buildings on campus for two years. I also held many 
                        of these jobs at the same time! </strong></p>
                    <p><strong> While in the Peds ICU, I chose to receive additional, non-necessary training and became Pediatric Advanced Life Support 
                        (PALS) certified. I also took additional training as well as in Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) which is basically 
                        dialysis. I also precepted (or trained) nurses that were new or our ICU and passed along what I knew!</strong></p>
                    <p><strong> My coding experiences right now center around JavaScript and C#. I have expanded on these topics and am now working in ASP.NET and Angular.
                        I have also learned and used SQL, Android Development, Node.js, and PowerShell.  I intend to keep working on perfecting these skills and
                        am excited to start learning more languages, methods, and technologies!</strong></p>
