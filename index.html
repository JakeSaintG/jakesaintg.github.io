                        <p><strong> Hi! I’m Jake St. Germain and I am an aspiring software developer. After nearly 5 years of being a Pediatric ICU Nurse, I
                            decided to pursue a longtime goal of mine and learn how to code. I have always had a love for tech and shown an aptitude for
                            learning quickly in the tech area. My time in the ICU has helped me to remain calm, cool, and collected under pressure and,
                            ideally, I will start to contribute to the tech space soon! </strong></p>
                        <p><strong> Random tidbits! Like the headline says, I am a cat enthusiast and have three of the fluffy jerks. I have built computers 
                            for myself and a few of my friends, recently re-learned how to play the trombone, and love spending time on my 
                            <a href="https://onewheel.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OneWheel!</a> I also like to spend my free time 
                            playing video games but lately I have been replacing that problem-solving itch with coding. </strong></p>

                        <p><strong> Starting with college, I attended the University of Louisville where I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Nursing. My
                            overall GPA was a 3.7/4.0 and I found myself on the Dean’s List for 3 Semesters and as a Dean’s Scholar for 2 Semesters. This was all
                            while having two jobs for most of those semesters! While being a nurse I strove for additional training in Pediatric Advanced Life Support
                            (PALS) as well as in PRISMA (Continuous Dialysis). Now time for coding! I started my dev career with Code Louisville through their front end course.
                            This also gave me access to Team Treehouse where I continued to soak in as much development knowledge as I could.</strong></p>

                        <p><strong> My first and foremost goal is to gain more experience in development. I hope to do as many sessions of Code Louisville as I 
                            can and continue to work through Team Treehouse’s catalog of coding education. I also hope to start to work in the tech industry soon!
                            My overall goal is to make software that, overall, helps people live better lives. I hope to utilize my experience in nursing and
                            apply to wherever I end up!</strong></p>

                    <h2 class="head">Experience</h2>
                    <p><strong> I worked pretty hard in college. In addition to a pretty difficult curriculum, I rotated through various positions within 
                        the Student Housing department at UofL. I was a Resident Assistant for four years, worked a desk/security job for a year, worked 
                        low-level maintenance/IT for a year, and then coordinated maintenance in two buildings on campus for two years. I also held many 
                        of these jobs at the same time! </strong></p>
                    <p><strong> While in the Peds ICU, I chose to receive additional, non-necessary training and became Pediatric Advanced Life Support 
                        (PALS) certified. I also took additional training as well as in Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) which is basically 
                        dialysis. I also precepted (or trained) nurses that were new or our ICU and passed along what I knew!</strong></p>
                    <p><strong> My coding experiences right now are limited to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I intend to keep working on perfecting 
                        these skills and am excited to start learning more languages, methods, and technologies soon!</strong></p>
